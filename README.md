# Mathree
 
 Mathree is a Kenyan sheng word for public transport vehicles.

 This is a small experiment on controlling mathrees with a navigation map and a MeshNavigationInstance.

 It uses the VehicleBody node in Godot as the basis for the mathree.

One Raycast figures out how far away an obstacle is, infront of the mathree and calculates the acceration factor from that 

Enjoy and reach out if you make any interesting changes or have questions. I'd love to see what can happen, from here.
